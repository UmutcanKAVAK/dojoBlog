# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- `npm start`: Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits, and lint errors will be shown in the console.

- `npm test`: Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](#) for more information.

- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode, optimizes the build for performance, and includes file hashes. Your app is now ready for deployment!

- `npm run eject`: **Note: this is a one-way operation.** Once you eject, you can't go back! If you're unsatisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies into your project, giving you full control over them.

   - **Remember:** You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments. However, if you want full customization, the option is there when you're ready.
